In a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/){target=_blank} you can use the [Stripe CLI feature](https://github.com/nullcoder/devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/stripe-cli){target=_blank}:

```json [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json]
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/nullcoder/devcontainer-features/stripe-cli:1": {}
  }
}
```
::

First you need to install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install){target=_blank}.

This step is platform dependant however here's quick instructions for Windows and Docker:

::tabs
  ::div
  ---
  label: Docker
  icon: i-simple-icons-docker
  ---

  ```bash [Terminal]
  docker run --rm -it stripe/stripe-cli:latest
  ```
  ::

  ::div
  ---
  label: Scoop
  icon: i-simple-icons-windowsxp
  ---

  ```bash [Terminal]
  scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
  scoop install stripe
  ```
  ::
::

Then login to your Stripe account:

```bash [Terminal]
stripe login
```

To retrive the webhook secret, navigate to the Stripe Dashboard and click on the `Developers` tab then click the `Test in a local environment` button, or just follow the direct link to the [Stripe Test Webhooks Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks/create?endpoint_location=local){target=_blank}.

Add the webhook secret to your `.env` file:

```ini [.env]
NUXT_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_"
```

You are now ready to receive webhooks events during development, the module will take care of running the Stripe CLI for you.

## Caveats

When local testing, there are some things to consider.

Stipe CLI session last for 60 days, after that you need to login again.

Stripe might rotate the CLI webhook secret when a new login occurs after some time, keep an eye on the logs and be aware of this.
