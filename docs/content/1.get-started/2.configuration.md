::callout{icon="i-heroicons-key"}
Head to your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys){target=_blank} to the API keys.
::

This module takes full advantage of the [Nuxt Runtime Configuration](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/runtime-config#environment-variables){target=_blank} so you don't have to configure anything.

Just add your Stripe keys and you are good to go!

```ini [.env]
# Publishable Key is prefixed with `pk_`
NUXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_<...>"

# Secret Key is prefixed with `sk_`
NUXT_STRIPE_SECRET="sk_"

# Webhook Secret is prefixed with `whsec_`
NUXT_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_"
```

That's it! You can now use the Stripe client-side and server-side with no additional configuration!

## Environment Variables

This module fallback to a common set of environment variables that are frequently used in other Stripe ecosystem.

If you already have `STRIPE_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment variables, you don't need to change anything, this module will automatically use it.

Here's the list of environment variables this module fallback to:

For the **Stripe Secret**:

```ini
# Highest priority
NUXT_STRIPE_SECRET="sk_"

# or
STRIPE_CLIENT_SECRET="sk_"

# or
STRIPE_SECRET="sk_"
```

For the **Stripe Webhook Secret**:

```ini
# Highest priority
NUXT_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_"

# or
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_"
```

Sometimes you might want to resolve the environment variables yourself while keeping this module resolution logic, here's how you can do it:

```ts [server/api/create-checkout-session.ts]
import {
  defaultStripeSecret,
  defaultStripeWebhookSecret
} from '@fixers/nuxt-stripe/server'

const webhookSecret = defaultStripeWebhookSecret()
const stripe = new Stripe(defaultStripeSecret())
```

We hate when a library hides useful functions away from you, that's why gladly export exactly what this module uses internally.

::

## Configuration

If you want to customize the module, you can do so by adding a `stripe` section to your `nuxt.config`, belows is an example:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  stripe: {
    // Do not hardcode your key
    publishableKey: '',

    // default Stripe Client options
    client: {
      locale: 'en'
    },

    // customize the webhook path, false to disable local webhook testing
    webhookPath: 'api/stripe/webhook'
  }
})
```

___

### `publishableKey`

The publishable key is used client-side to initialize the Stripe client.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  stripe: {
    publishableKey: '',
  }
})
```

Nuxt uses a strict logic to infer the runtime environment variables, as such, if you want this module to automatically handle the publishable key for you, you must use the `NUXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variable.

```ini
NUXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_<...>"
```

Head over the [Nuxt Runtime Configuration](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/runtime-config#environment-variables){target=_blank} to learn more on how to environment variables are handled in Nuxt.

#### With T3 env

To fully customize the publishable key in the client, you can use [T3 env](https://env.t3.gg/docs/nuxt){target=_blank}, here's how you can configure it.

Install the `@t3-oss/env-nuxt` package along with `zod`:

```bash
pnpm add @t3-oss/env-nuxt zod
```

Create the `env/client` file:

```ts [env/client.ts]
import { createEnv } from '@t3-oss/env-nuxt'
import { z } from 'zod'

export const env = createEnv({
  client: {
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: z.string().min(1),
  },
})
```

In your checkout page:

```vue [Checkout.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import { env } from '~~/env/client'
const { createClient: createStripeClient } = useStripe()

const stripe = await createStripeClient({
  publishableKey: env.STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
})
</script>
```

___

### `client`

The client options are passed directly to the Stripe client, you can use it to customize the locale for example.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  stripe: {
    client: {
      locale: 'en'
    }
  }
})
```

Head over the official [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/js/initializing#init_stripe_js-options){target=_blank} to learn more about the available options.

You can override the default in the `createClient` method:

```vue [Checkout.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { createClient: createStripeClient } = useStripe()

const stripe = await createStripeClient({
  stripeAccount: 'acct_',
  locale: 'en'
})
</script>
```

`createClient` is a thin wrapper around the `window.Stripe` constructor, you can pass any option you want, they will be passed directly to the Stripe client.

___

### `webhookPath`

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
This option is not exposed to `useRuntimeConfig()` as it's only needed in development. :br
If you need access the webhook path location at runtime, [here's how you can do it](#expose-the-webhook-path-to-useruntimeconfig).
::

The webhook path is mainly used for local testing, in production it generally does not matter where your webhook endpoint is located.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  stripe: {
    webhookPath: 'api/stripe-webhook-path'
  }
})
```

And make sure your endpoint actually exists:

```ts [server/api/stripe-webhook-path.ts]
export default defineStripeWebhook(() => {
  // ...
})
```

#### Expose the Webhook Path to `useRuntimeConfig()`

To access the webhook path at runtime, add it to the `runtimeConfig` in the `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: {
    stripe: {
      webhookPath: 'api/stripe-webhook-path'
    },
    // If you need it on the client
    public: {
      stripe: {
        webhookPath: 'api/stripe-webhook-path'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Webhook

::callout{to="/stripe-cli"}
You need to install the [Stripe CLI](/stripe-cli) for local testing.
::

This module comes with a built-in webhook handler, you can use it to receive webhook events from Stripe.

Create the file `api/stripe/webhook.ts`:

```ts [server/api/stripe/webhook.ts]
import { defineStripeWebhook } from '@fixers/nuxt-stripe/server'

/**
 * @param event - the H3 event
 * @param stipe - the Stripe instance
 * @param stripeEvent - the Stripe Webhook event
 */
export default defineStripeWebhook(({ event, stripe, stripeEvent }) => {
  switch (stripeEvent.type) {
    case 'payment_intent.succeeded': {
      return {
        customEventCode: 123,
        result: 'This message is available in the Stripe dashboard!'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Any value you return will be available in the Stripe dashboard:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "customEventCode": 123,
    "result": "This message is available in the Stripe dashboard!"
  }
}
```

When no value is returned, the payload will only contains `{ ok: true }`.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
Be careful altering the [H3](https://github.com/unjs/h3){target=_blank} `event` when you are using the build in event handler.
If you absolutely need a cutting-edge custom behavior, handle the webhook manually.
::

### Error Handling

Any unhandled exception will be caught and returned to Stripe as a `400` error.

The payload will be available in the Stripe dashboard as follow:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "<The error message>"
  }
}
```

You can `throw` at any time to return an error to Stripe, this module will catch any error, extract the message and return it to Stripe in the `error.message` field.

```ts [api/stripe/webhook.ts]
export default defineStripeWebhook(() => {
  throw new Error('This error will be returned to Stripe!')
})
```

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "This error will be returned to Stripe!"
  }
}
```

This module perform some validation on the error object to ensure the error stack is never returned to Stripe, this is a security measure to prevent leaking sensitive information.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-shield-exclamation"}
Not sharing your Stripe dashboard foolishly around is a much better security measure.
::

### Event Handling

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb" to="/advanced/custom-webhook"}
Head over the [Advanced Custom Webhook](/advanced/custom-webhook) section to learn how to fully customize the webhook handler.
::

The `stripeEvent` is a [Stripe.Event](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/object){target=_blank} object, you can use it to access the event type and data.

We have setup a little example on how to handle the different event types in TypeScript:

```ts [server/api/stripe/webhook.ts]
import type { Stripe } from 'stripe'
import { defineStripeWebhook } from '@fixers/nuxt-stripe/server'

export default defineStripeWebhook(({ event, stripe, stripeEvent }) => {
  switch (stripeEvent.type) {
    case 'payment_intent.succeeded': {
      const paymentIntent = stripeEvent.data.object as Stripe.PaymentIntent
      break
    }

    case 'checkout.session.expired': {
      const session = stripeEvent.data.object as Stripe.Checkout.Session
      break
    }

    case 'customer.created' : {
      const customer = stripeEvent.data.object as Stripe.Customer
      break
    }
  }
})
```

### Webhook Path

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
This section is only relevant if you want to use the local testing functionality.
::

By now surely you have notice we have use the webhook path `api/stripe/webhook` quite alot as that's the default path this module uses, you can customize it in the module options:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  stripe: {
    webhookPath: 'api/stripe/webhook'
  }
})
```

However, this settings is important only if you want to use this module local testing functionality as this module need to know where to proxy the webhook requests.

You can turn off the local testing by setting `webhookPath` to `false`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  stripe: {
    webhookPath: false
  }
})
```

And that's pretty much it, head over the [Stripe CLI section](/stripe-cli) to start testing your webhook locally!

## Caveats

This module allows you to access the `defineStripeWebhook` directly from the `@fixers/nuxt-stripe/server` package, you can still however use the virtual module `#stripe` syntax.

You might wonder why, that's because resolving virtual module outside nuxt can be challenging.

By not relying an any virtual module resolution on the server side, this module allows you to test critical server-side logic completely independent from Nuxt, making unit testing much easier.

_Trust us, it's worth it, we have built a [multi-million dollar e-learning](#) with this!_
